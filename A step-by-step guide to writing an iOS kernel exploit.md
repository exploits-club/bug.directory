## Exploits Club Summary:
> If you like write-ups which are **well written, concise, and manage to be extremely technical while foregoing the "in the attached 700 line code snippet..."**, [@alfiecg_dev](https://x.com/alfiecg_dev?ref=blog.exploits.club) somehow has managed to do just that. The post released this week documents how **he approached exploitation for** [**PhysPuppet**](https://github.com/felix-pb/kfd/blob/main/writeups/physpuppet.md?ref=blog.exploits.club)**, a physical-use-after-free.** The blog starts with a quick **refresher on page-tables** and memory management in XNU. It then **defines a physical-use-after-free, explains why it is a powerful primitive, and shows how spraying `IOSurface` objects can help to identify the dangling PTE and subsequently achieve arbitrary R/W.** And he does all of that in just 2,235 words. Unreal.
