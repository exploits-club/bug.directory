## Exploits Club Summary:
> Have you ever sat down and thought "gosh, I wish someone would just document **how Binder works from front-to-back**"? Well, it appears thats what the Android Red Team had the same idea. Following their Binder research presented earlier this year at [OffensiveCON](https://www.offensivecon.org/speakers/2024/eugene-rodionov,-zi-fan-tan-and-gulshan-singh.html?ref=blog.exploits.club), the team has now released just under **9k words going through all things Binder internals.** The post is broken into 5 major sections: **Lifetimes of Objects, Concurrency Model, Workqueues and Work Items, Binder's Buffer Allocator, and the Transaction stack.** It comes complete with supporting **code snippets for each subsystem and diagrams to help visualize some of the more complex dataflows**. Overall, its a golden resource for anyone in the Android space who is interested in getting spun up on Binder quickly.
