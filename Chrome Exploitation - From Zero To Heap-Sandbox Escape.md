## Exploits Club Summary:
> [@matteomalvica](https://x.com/matteomalvica?ref=blog.exploits.club) released his BSides Oslo slides **discussing Chrome exploitation.** The slides start with **a quick overview of the Chrome architecture and then discuss the V8 pipeline and it's various JIT compilers.** Afterwards, it takes a **look at type confusion bugs,** leveraging **three case studies from different time periods** to demonstrate how the meta has shifted along with the increase in mitigations. And if you have followed us for a while, you know we love a good slide-deck...this one comes decked out with diagrams, code snippets, and a concept art sketches for what would we assume would be a banger sci-fi hacker show.
