## Exploits Club Summary:
> A new post out of [Theori](https://theori.io/?ref=blog.exploits.club) this week walks through a _different_ **Linux race-condition leading to UAF.** The bug happens during the **TCP Authentication Option connection initiation and stems from improper usage of the Read-Copy-Update API** (which the post covers at length). To reliably win the race, **the team leveraged** [**ExpRace**](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/lee-yoochan?ref=blog.exploits.club), which was initially presented at [USENIX '21](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21?ref=blog.exploits.club).
