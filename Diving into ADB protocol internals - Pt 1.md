## Exploits Club Summary:
> Chances are pretty high that if you've done any work with Android, you've probably used ADB. But have you ever thought about how it works under the hood? Thankfully, Synacktiv jumped on their blog to answer that question for you. The first post in the series takes a detailed look at the protocol and the client-server relationship. The team then discusses how they implemented the protocol for their open-source Rust crate. Part 2 is expected to talk through useful improvements to their Rust implementation, which we will, of course, summarize here when it's available.
