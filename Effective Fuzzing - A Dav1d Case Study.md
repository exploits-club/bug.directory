## Exploits Club Summary:
> If you've been paying attention to the VR landscape over the last year or so, then you know **"Oh its fuzzed by oss-fuzz" is rarely the end-of-story for finding bugs in open source projects.** P0 returns this week to further that point. In this post, guest blogger Nick Galloway explains how he was able to **find two integer overflows in Dav1d, an AV1 video decoder**. After reviewing the oss-fuzz harnesses, he realized **constraints had manually been put in place for memory purposes,** effectively reducing the total coverage. By removing these, his **fuzzer was able to find new codepaths and in turn, new bugs.** He also discusses a handful of other ways he improved coverage, such as fuzzing on a different architecture or changing the amount of threads the fuzzer can create.
