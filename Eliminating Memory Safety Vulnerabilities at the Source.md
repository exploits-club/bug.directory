## Exploits Club Summary:
> This week, Google posted some analytics related their continued journey towards eradicating memory corruption vulnerabilities. The piece opens with some numbers intended to support the overall central thesis: vulnerabilities in a codebase decay exponentially with time.  While the lines of unsafe code have gone up slightly in AOSP over the last 5 years, the majority of new features have been written in Rust, and as such a 52% decrease in memory safety bugs has been observed As the software industry has matured, it's approach to memory safety has gone through a number of stages. Google doesn't necessarily think you should just "re-write it in Rust" ... but maybe focusing on the Rust adoption in your newer features could be worthwhile.
