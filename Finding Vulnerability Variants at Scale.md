## Exploits Club Summary:
> A fun new blog post on variant analysis at scale from [@0xFBFBFBFB](https://x.com/0xFBFBFBFB?ref=blog.exploits.club) via [Blackwing Intelligence](https://x.com/blackwinghq?ref=blog.exploits.club)'s blog. The post starts by **discussing a vulnerability he identified by fuzzing an old library called jpeg-recompress** during a security audit of a large project. The bug itself is an **int overflow which is subsequently used as apart of a buffer size calculation, leading to a heap overflow.** The bug was the result of improper usage of a function in `libjpeg`, likely due to some confusion surrounding the documentation. Because of this, 0xFBFBFBFB decided that **some other projects may have fallen victim to the same pattern**, so he decided to go on the hunt. He first used **BigQuery against the `bigquery-public-data.github_repos`** dataset. Of the 10,440 repos that returned, he then **checked which ones had pre-compiled CodeQL databases**, and from there **identified 104 other codebases which were potentially vulnerable**. The post ends with a chart of the **affected software, including some heavy hitters like Chromium and WINE.**
