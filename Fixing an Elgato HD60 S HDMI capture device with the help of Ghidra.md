## Exploits Club Summary:
> If you like hardware, firmware, and hacking war stories, then [@dt_db](https://x.com/dt_db) has got an absolute banger of a post for you. The self-proclaimed lover-of-repair-videos decided to try his hand at restoring some non-working tech and picked up a 2nd hand, dysfunctional Elgato capture card off of Ebay. What followed is documented in his lengthy blog post, going through chip identification, hardware hacking, firmware dumping, and manual patching. It's a fun read, and one that spares no details about the journey to get the device and it's LEDs back in a working order.
