## Exploits Club Summary:
> Another Google team got to check off that "blog post" OKR this week before the start of Q4. The Android Red Team released a write-up in collaboration with Arm Product Security detailing their assessment Mali GPU assessment. The team had the opportunity to poke at both the firmware and associated kernel driver, finding bugs in both. While the post doesn't go to technical on the bugs, it does link out to the associated advisories. The post starts with some broad generalities about why the attack surface is interesting, before talking about their approach to the assessment itself which consisted mainly of fuzzing and formal verification.
