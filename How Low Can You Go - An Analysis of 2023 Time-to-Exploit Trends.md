## Exploits Club Summary:
>  A bit more on the Threat Intel side of the house, but [Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) released their **analysis regarding time-to-exploit trends in 2023.** The big takeaways from the report are nicely summarized in the cute infographic at the beginning, including that **70% of the vulnerabilities they analyzed were first exploited as zero-days**, and the average **time-to-exploit for n-days was 5 day**s. Soooo yeah...may want to revisit those SLA windows.
