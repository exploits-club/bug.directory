## Exploits Club Summary:
> A quick and fun RCA for a recent Hyper-V OOB read patched by Microsoft. The post starts with a quick overview of the vulnerability itself, which occurs in `vhdmp.sys` and results from the incorrect calculation of an output buffer size, resulting in the read out of bounds. The post then walks through a quick PoC for the bug, before discussing the patch put in place. As mentioned by the author, this was labeled as severe and potentially useable for an EoP which _might_ not quite be the case.
