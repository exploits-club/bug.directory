## Exploits Club Summary:
> The third and final part detailing how a **24 year old bug can be used to exploit the PHP engine** was released earlier this week. This part builds on the exploit detailed in [part 2](https://www.ambionics.io/blog/iconv-cve-2024-2961-p2?ref=blog.exploits.club), **this time making it more generic and not dependent on any program output.** The exploitation strategy starts by allocating a l**arge amount of byte buffers of varying sizes, and then strategically using the corruption to achieve an arbitrary read primitive** (after jumping through a few hurdles). It then uses this arbitrary read to **find the addresses necessary to further exploitation, such as `system` and `malloc`.** After this, it is able to use the **same exploit strategy as detailed in the original 2 parts.**
