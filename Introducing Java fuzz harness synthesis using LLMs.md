## Exploits Club Summary:
> OSS-Fuzz is *back* to talk about their ongoing LLM harness generation project. This time, the team has been focusing on how the project has been extended to work with everyone's favorite language, Java. The post takes a look at a Java fuzz harness sample before walking through a number of challenges associated with auto-generation such as object construction and exception handling. The team then shows 4 reliability bugs caught with generated harnesses, and concludes with some thoughts and ideas for future work.
