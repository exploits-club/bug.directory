## Exploits Club Summary:
> [@SinSinology](https://x.com/SinSinology?ref=blog.exploits.club) released a post detailing a**n auth bypass he found in the** [**Telerick Report Server**](https://www.telerik.com/report-server?ref=blog.exploits.club)**, and how it could be combined with a deserialization vuln to achieve a full chain.** This research stemmed from an advisory for the deserialization issue which initially claimed to be reachable by an unauthenticated user, but was later updated to reflect permissions were needed. Thus, **he set out to find an auth bypass and then to exploit the 1-day deserialization vuln.** The post is extremely in depth, covering **the internals of the report server, concepts for advanced .NET deserialization, and his attacker thought process.**
