## Exploits Club Summary:
> **The Pixel 9 line-up is coming with some changes to baseband security** and Google wants you to know about it. In a post released last week, the team talks through **why baseband is such a popular attack surface - from the remote reachability to the lack of mitigations**. From there, the team talks through what they are doing about it, specifically on this most recent release of phones. **The Pixel 9 line-up ships with a handful of additional mitigations baked into the baseband firmware, such as stack canaries, CFI, and sanatizers.** The post also **points out the continued increase in monetary incentive for independent research to submit their bare-metal firmware bugs to the VRP program.**
