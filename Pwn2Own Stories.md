## Exploits Club Summary:
> A bit late to this one but [**@bdmcbri**](https://x.com/bdmcbri?ref=blog.exploits.club)**'s Pwn2Own stories talk hit YouTube a few weeks back.** The talk goes through some of the t**argets he has gone after, his success, failures, and overall learnings.** The talk shines for the way it **emphasizes the usefulness in taking a simple approach and not being overly concerned about the myriad of unknowns** associated when targeting something like a SCADA devices for the first time. Along the way, the talk goes over a handful of Ben's entries, **ranging from .NET and Java deserialization bugs to crypto weaknesses.** If you are interested in participating in Pwn2Own for the first time, **this talk is there to get you on your way and show you the barrier to entry maybe lower than you think**
