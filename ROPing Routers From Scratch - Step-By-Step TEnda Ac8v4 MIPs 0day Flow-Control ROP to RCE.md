## Exploits Club Summary:
> We think [@retr0reg](https://x.com/retr0reg?ref=blog.exploits.club) summed up all of our thoughts nicely at the start of this post with the following line: **"Not sure why but I am always obsessed with assemblies, caller stacks, and glibc heaps and kinds of stuff."** The write-up takes a previous bug [@retr0reg](https://x.com/retr0reg?ref=blog.exploits.club) found and walks through the process for writing an exploit for it. The post **discusses testing environment set-up before writing a ROP chain on a MIPs device.** Whether you are interested in getting up to speed on MIPs specifically or writing real-world exploits for 1-days, this is a great primer.
