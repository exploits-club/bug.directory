## Exploits Club Summary:
> This week, the keynote from FUZZING'24 was made available on YouTube. The talk looks at the history of fuzzing in the community and some of the more memorable bugs that helped shape the modern sentiment around the technique. The presentation then attempts to answer why fuzzing continues to be such a successful method for finding bugs. It then ends with thoughts on the future of fuzzing, including everyone's favorite topic...AI. On that note, the same channel uploaded another talk from the conference aptly titled [Is "AI" Useful For Fuzzing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPJXmrdmls&ab_channel=InternationalFuzzingWorkshop)
