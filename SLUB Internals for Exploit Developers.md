## Exploits Club Summary:
>  The best resource to date on SLUB internals released this week. [@andreyknvl](https://x.com/andreyknvl) (maintainer of the   [Linux Kernel Exploitation](https://github.com/xairy/linux-kernel-exploitation#linux-kernel-exploitation)GitHub) released the slides and recording from his talk at Linux Security Summit Europe 2024. He states the talk's goal is to "fill the void" on SLUB internals, as no exploit write-ups cover it in-depth and no developer articles discuss exploitation. It certainly seems to achieve that goal, walking through the internals and then turning around to explain how they are used and abused within typical bug classes. This is one you're sure to want to bookmark, as you'll probably return to it a few times.
