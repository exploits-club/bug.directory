## Exploits Club Summary:
> Google continues to push their **memory safety blog posts** on a semi-regular cadence these days, and this week has proven to be no different. In their newest post, the team recounts **progress made thus** far towards mitigating memory corruption bugs and **discusses what the future holds -** including areas where re-writes in Rust may make sense and how they plan to **continue improving code safety in non-memory safe codebases**. They conclude by mentioning this is the f**irst in a series of blog posts that will go deeper on the logistics,** so we are looking forward to future entries.
