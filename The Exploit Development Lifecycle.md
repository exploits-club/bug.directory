## Exploits Club Summary:
> [@chompie1337](https://x.com/chompie1337?ref=blog.exploits.club) released her **keynote slides from** [**BSidesCanberra**](https://x.com/BSidesCbr?ref=blog.exploits.club) **about exploit development.** The talk goes through **the timeline typically associated with finding and exploiting a bug, and how that typically only a small part of the exploit dev lifecycle.** It goes into the logistics of **weird machines, stability, maintenance, stealth**...you know, all the stuff you ignore when you ROP to system on your shitty side project and call it a day. This one is **pretty much mandatory viewing for anyone in the space.** Also, the deck itself has such an aesthetic...we suddenly have the urge to throw on a pink sweater and take our laptops over to the nearest 1950s diner.
