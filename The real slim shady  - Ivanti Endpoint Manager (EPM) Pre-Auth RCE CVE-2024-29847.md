## Exploits Club Summary:
>  [@SinSinology](https://x.com/SinSinology) released a post this week detailing a pre-auth RCE he found in...you guessed it...an Ivanti product. The post doubles as a primer on .NET Remoting and its (many) downfalls. Specifically, the post looks at some of the previous work by [@tiraniddo](https://x.com/tiraniddo) and demonstrates how exploitation can be a bit more difficult constrained when with [Low Type Filter is enabled](https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2019/10/bypassing-low-type-filter-in-net.html). The post takes Forshaw's 2019 methods and demonstrates how they can be applied directly to the Ivanti vuln, concluding with the release of a limited compiled PoC (sorry, script kiddies).
