## Exploits Club Summary:
> [Watchtowr](https://watchtowr.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) and enterprise software go together like white-on-rice. This week, they took a stab at a recently reported critical vuln in Veeam Backup and Response, [CVE-2024-40711](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40711?ref=blog.exploits.club). The post starts with a **patch diff, where they identify that a well-known deserialization gadget has been added to the blacklist.** From there, it's off to the races with an **overview of Veeam's .NET remoting internals, a deep...deep dive into the interesting code paths, and finally, some .NET deserialization goodies.** The post finishes with an overview of the silent authentication patch the team implemented, making the advisory slightly confusing. And while you are on Watchtowr's blog, you should **_also_ take a look at the post they put out yesterday about** [**becoming admins of .mobi**](https://labs.watchtowr.com/we-spent-20-to-achieve-rce-and-accidentally-became-the-admins-of-mobi/?ref=blog.exploits.club)**.**
