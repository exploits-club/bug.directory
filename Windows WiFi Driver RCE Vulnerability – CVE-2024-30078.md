## Exploits Club Summary:
> Speaking of teams who have been pushing out blog posts recently, [Crowdfense](https://www.crowdfense.com/?ref=blog.exploits.club) has returned to the interwebs **with an RCA and exploitability analysis of** [**CVE-2024-30078**](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30078?ref=blog.exploits.club)**.** The post starts with a **bindiff of the patched WiFi driver** and then dissects the code changes. The team identified the bug stems from **improper handling of packet data when translating IEEE 802.11 packets to Ethernet packets, which results in a 4-byte overflow.** The blog then talks through the limitations of this bug, ultimately **deciding it may not be critical/exploitable but eager to be proved wrong.**
